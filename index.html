        <h2>WEB</h2>
        <p>
            The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN. He conceived it as an information management system using several concepts and technologies, the most fundamental of which was the connections that existed between information.[8][9][10] The first proposal was written in 1989,[7] and a working system implemented by the end of 1990 including the WorldWideWeb browser and an HTTP server.[11] The technology was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public on 23 August 1991.
